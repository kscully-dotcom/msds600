    "# Week 8 assignment: NLP on social media data\n",
    "\n",
    "Take our social media we collected last week and:\n",
    "\n",
    "- extract the sentiment scores of the titles of the posts\n",
    "    - you can use the keyword method, Python packages, or other methods to extract the sentiment scores\n",
    "- plot a histogram of the sentiment scores\n",
    "- look at descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) of the sentiment scores\n",
    "- examine the text for some of the highest and lowest sentiment scores\n",
    "- write a short analysis of the results and our process, as well as propose one idea for something we could use this data for\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional advanced challenges:\n",
    "- Compare different sentiment analysis methods (e.g. textblob and VADER). Does one seem to work better than another?\n",
    "- Get the sentiments of the comments for each post. We can do a lot with this, such as:\n",
    "    - look at the average sentiment for each post and compare it with the sentiment of the title and/or text\n",
    "    - look at the distribution of sentiments for each post and find the posts with the widest range of sentiments (controversial posts)\n",
    "- Examine the subjectivity of our data (e.g. using textblob)\n",
    "- Use topic modeling on the posts\n",
    "    - you can also add in the comments to the topic model\n",
    "- Look at the most frequent words for positive and negative sentiment posts\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There is no assignment solution file for this week."

    "I loaded my sql query for the SustainableFashion subreddit. I then combined the title and text strings into one column to prepare for sentiment analysis. I used textblob to complete the sentiment analysis where I found that the average sentiment score was about .15 while the most frequent sentiment score was a neutral 0. I was interested in the correlation between the score of the post and the sentiment score. I wanted to know whether or not the sentiment score could predict a higher score for a post or if it was even related at all. I broke down the highest sentiment scores and ran a frequency distribution to find the most common words. Later, I will use this data to run sentiment analysis on each word and run a TopicAnalysis on the highest scoring posts. There wasn't anything that really stood out to me about the words other than they were part of a theme and some of the posts may be controversial. Another analysis to conduct would be to find the correlations between controversiality and scores. As for the scores vs sentiment scores: The highest scores were most frequently associated with neutral sentiments and a 0.5 sentiment. The lowest scores were on the poles of best sentiment to worst. There is a very slight trend where the higher the sentiment score the greater the score caping at 0.75 and a score of 250."
